## Installation and Usage
Node.js is required for this application to run


## General Info
The application is a simple note-taking web service that will allow users to type simple notes with a title and description, and save them to a list. The saved notes can be deleted at any time. This is my first application that was deployed using a web hosting service, [Render](https://render.com/).

This note-taking application was created using starter code, provided by the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp, which can be found [here](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/miniature-eureka).
